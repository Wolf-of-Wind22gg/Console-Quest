
 Hey there, game creator Jeffrey here.

 I just wanted to give some quick directives before starting the game.
 There are two user created modules used in this game: graphics and colorama.
 The graphics module is already included in this folder, but colorama will have to be downloaded separately.
 You can use a quick 'pip install colorama' in the command line if you have pip.

 Documentation and download for personal use can be found here:

 Graphics:

 Colorama:

 This game won't run without them.
 Also, while the whole game can be run from your IDE of choice or command prompt, I recommend using GitBash.
 After that, run play_game.py
 This is done by navigating to the folder that play_game.py is stored in with the line 
     "cd Documents/Console Quest"
 If the folder is saved elsewhere, you will need to replace "Documents" with something else instead.
 To run the file, type "python play_game.py"
 

 
 I hope you have a fun time playing my game.
 Oh, and the recommended level for fighting the orc is ~15.
